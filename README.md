# Air-quality-index-prediction


This project presents a literature review of predicting air quality using Machine learning techniques and
forecast the air pollution levels so that preventive measures can be taken by the people in order to
minimize the air pollution. The air pollution databases were extracted from the US Embassy and
Consulates in India. The proposed Machine Learning (ML) model is promising in prediction context for the Delhi AQI. Now, these analysed results are very much helpful in improvement of accuracy for the
predictions, hence they can be applied to other cities as well.

Data Description and Analysis-
The dataset provided for this study contains two separate files-
1. ‘Complete’ (Train Data)—which consists of all years’ (2016-2020) data

2. ‘weather-2021’ (Test Data)—consisting of the weather data of year 2021 that has to be predicted.
All the sets contain seven variables; Temperature, Max Temp, Min Temp, ATM, Relative Humidity, Average
Visibility, Wind Speed, Maximum Wind Speed and PM 2.5, where the Pm 2.5 is the response variable
indicated with 1 and 0 (good/poor).
